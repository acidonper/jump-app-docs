# Service Mesh

A service mesh is a dedicated network for service-to-service communications. When using a service mesh, the supporting services for distributed applications are provided via the container platform and service mesh.

Based on the open source Istio project, Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh provides a platform for behavioral insight and operational control over your networked microservices in a service mesh.

In *Jump App*, Service Mesh manages microservices' traffic in order to provide traffic management, observability features, flow control, etc.
